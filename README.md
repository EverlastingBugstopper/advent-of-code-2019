# ðŸŽ… Advent of Code 2019

This repository contains my Rust solutions for the [2019 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Usage

My Advent of Code solutions are run and compiled with the awesome [aoc-runner](https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc) crate.

If you'd like to run these solutions for yourself, you should install `cargo-aoc` with `cargo install cargo-aoc`, check out this repository, and then run `cargo aoc -day x` where `x` is the day you'd like to see the solutions for.
