# Advent of Code 2019

This repository contains my solutions for the [2019 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

## Usage

If you have rust installed you can clone this repository and run `cargo run {day}` to get the answer given the input in that day's `input.rs`. So if I wanted to get the solution for day 2, I would run `cargo run 2`.

I might clean this up a bit and provide a way to provide an input file but for now this is just a quick bootstrap.
